# CodeIgniter 4 Rest api application

 Nowadays I'm learning api's..

 This is a first try.. Still rookie.. Too basic rest api simple written in php framework named CodeIgniter4

 I'll update this repo step by step, currently thinking about adding Oauth2 or JWT.. If i can deal with it i'll connect this with a vue.js application soon.

 As i told you I'm newbee there will more mistakes then I thought
